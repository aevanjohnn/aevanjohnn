### **About Me**



I'm a computer enthusiast who loves learning languages both programming and spoken. I am currently studying Computer Science through ***Open Source Society University*** (OSSU), in addition to my technical pursuits, I'm also a graphic designer and when I'm not coding or designing, you can find me with my nose buried in a book or listening to music; enjoying the simple things in life. I'm just a simple person who loves to learn and grow. Thanks for stopping by!
