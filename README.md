## **About Me**

<br>

I'm a computer enthusiast who loves learning languages both programming and spoken. I am currently studying Computer Science through ***Open Source Society University*** (OSSU), in addition to my technical pursuits, I'm also a graphic designer and when I'm not coding or designing, you can find me with my nose buried in a book or listening to music; enjoying the simple things in life. I'm just a simple person who loves to learn and grow. Thanks for stopping by!

## **Programming Languages**

These are all of the programming languages that I know; most of which I am already proficient in and some of which I am still currently learning. I have also included here some of the languages that can't really be considered a programming language in a traditional sense (e.g. HTML5, CSS3, etc.)
